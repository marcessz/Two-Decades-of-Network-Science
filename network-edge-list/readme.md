### __There's a newer version of this network that you can find [in this repository](https://github.com/marcessz/Twenty-Years-of-Network-Science).__


**The edge list of the co-authorship network of network scientists can be found in the** ```edgelist.xlsx``` **file** <br>
The edge list is written in the following format:

| source | target |
|--------|--------|
|      0 |      1 |
|      0 |      2 |
|      1 |      2 |
|      3 |      4 |

Each network scientist is represented by their ID number.
